2).Create an Obj file in c without generating an exe file. 
Steps to create an .obj file without generating an executable:
Write your C code: For example, create a simple C file named example.c:

// example.c
#include <stdio.h>

void hello() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}

Compile without linking:
Use the -c flag in gcc to compile the source file into an object file, but not link it to create an executable.

Here's the command:
gcc -c example.c -o example.obj

Explanation of command:
gcc: The GNU C Compiler command.
-c: This tells the compiler to generate an object file (.obj on Windows, .o on Linux) and not link it.
example.c: Your C source file.
-o example.obj: Specifies the name of the output object file (example.obj).

3).What are the flags that can be passed to C compiler.

General Flags
-c
Compile the source code into an object file without linking. This is used to create .o or .obj files.
gcc -c file.c

-o <file>
Specify the name of the output file (can be executable or object file).
gcc file.c -o output_executable

-Wall
Enable all common warning messages.
gcc file.c -Wall

-Werror
Treat all warnings as errors.
gcc file.c -Werror

-I <dir>
Add a directory to the list of directories searched for header files (.h files).
gcc -I /path/to/headers file.c

-L <dir>
Add a directory to the list of directories searched for libraries during linking.
gcc -L /path/to/libs -o file file.c

-l <library>
Link with a library. For example, -lm links with the math library.
gcc file.c -lm

Debugging Flags
-g
Generate debugging information to be used with debugging tools such as gdb.
gcc -g file.c

-ggdb
Produce debugging information specifically for gdb.
gcc -ggdb file.c

Optimization Flags
-O0
No optimization (default). The compiler focuses on reducing compile time.
gcc -O0 file.c

-O1
Basic optimization. This reduces code size and execution time without increasing compilation time significantly.
gcc -O1 file.c

-O2
Further optimization. Increases both compile time and execution time efficiency.
gcc -O2 file.c

-O3
Maximum optimization, including aggressive optimizations.
gcc -O3 file.c

-Os
Optimize for size. This enables all optimizations that don't increase the size of the code.
gcc -Os file.c

Linking Flags
-static
Statically link libraries. This bundles all libraries into the executable, which can make the binary larger but self-contained.
gcc -static file.c -o file

-shared
Create a shared library (.so file on Linux or .dll on Windows).
gcc -shared -o libexample.so file.c

-fPIC
Generate position-independent code, necessary when creating shared libraries.
gcc -fPIC -shared -o libexample.so file.c

Profiling and Analysis Flags
-pg
Enable profiling for performance analysis using gprof.
gcc -pg file.c

-fprofile-generate
Enable generation of profile information for profile-guided optimization.
gcc -fprofile-generate file.

-fprofile-use
Use profile information from previous runs to optimize the current run.
gcc -fprofile-use file.c

Architecture-specific Flags
-march=<arch>
Generate code for a specific architecture (e.g., -march=native for the local machine's architecture).
gcc -march=native file.c

-m32 / -m64
Compile the program for 32-bit or 64-bit architecture.
gcc -m32 file.c

Preprocessor Flags
-D<macro>
Define a macro for use in the code.
gcc -DDEBUG file.c

-U<macro>
Undefine a macro.
gcc -UDEBUG file.c

Miscellaneous Flags
-E
Preprocess the file but don’t compile. This outputs the preprocessed code to standard output.
gcc -E file.c

-S
Compile the file to assembly code (.s file).
gcc -S file.c

-v
Verbose output to see exactly what the compiler is doing.
gcc -v file.c

--version
Show the version of the compiler.
gcc --version

4).Give inputs to program using command line.
The C language provides a method to pass parameters to the main() function. This is
typically accomplished by specifying arguments on the operating system command line
(console).
The prototype for main() looks like:
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 {
 …
 }
There are two parameters passed to main(). The first parameter is the number of items
on the command line (int argc). Each argument on the command line is separated by
one or more spaces, and the operating system places each argument directly into its own
null-terminated string. The second parameter passed to main() is an array of pointers
to the character strings containing each argument (char *argv[]).
For example, at the command prompt:
test_prog 1 apple orange 4096.0
There are 5 items on the command line, so the operating system will set argc=5 . The
parameter argv is a pointer to an array of pointers to strings of characters, such that:
argv[0] is a pointer to the string “test_prog”
argv[1] is a pointer to the string “1”
argv[2] is a pointer to the string “apple”
argv[3] is a pointer to the string “orange”
and
argv[4] is a pointer to the string “4096.0”
Notes
• The main() routine can check argc to see how many arguments the user
specified.
• The minimum count for argc is 1: the command line just contained the name of
the invoked program with no arguments.
• The program can find out its own name as it was invoked: it is stored in the
argv[0] string! Some operating systems don't provide this feature, however.
• The arguments from the command line are not automatically converted: the
characters are just copied into the argv strings. 
•If an argument on the command line is to be interpreted as a numerical constant,
such as argv[1] and argv[4] in this example, it can be converted using a
string conversion.
int int_val; float float_val;
sscanf(argv[1],”%d”,&int_val);
sscanf(argv[4],”%f”,&float_val);
and
printf(“The 3rd and 4th items on the command line are %s and
%s\n”, argv[2], argv[3]);
results in:
The 3rd and 4th items on the command line are apple and orange
The string functions atoi(), atol(), atof(), etc., will also work.
